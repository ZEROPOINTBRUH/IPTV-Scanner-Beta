# IPTV Scanner 
IPTV Scanner is a tool used scan, sort, and filter live channels provided by [iptv-org](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv). The goal here is to go through each channel every three hours to scan if the channel is active, if active, the channel will be listed on iptv_streams.json, Dead steams will end up dead_streams.json, any steams that have no valid link `404, 401, etc` will end up in dead_streams.json. We've also provided a webgui guide that will show you what active channels has been found and what is active and ready to watch with a click of the button. You can copy and paste the link to a platform or media player of your desire or download and run the service through a select choice of external applications.
